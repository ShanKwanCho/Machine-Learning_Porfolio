ELO Merchant Category Recommendation ( Kaggle Competition )

ELO has ML models to understand the importance of aspects and preferences for
their customerâ€™s lifecycle.

We use Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to predict the customer loyalty.
So we can give better opportunities to most loyalty customers (i.e. promotions )
